Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary words and phrases to keep it to one page.
*   **ATS Optimization:** Uses keywords directly from the job description (e.g., "Kubernetes", "GCP", "Agile Methodologies", "SpringBoot"). The "Key Skills" section is formatted as a simple list, which is ideal for ATS parsing.
*   **Relevance:** Prioritized skills and experience that align directly with the Kyosk job description.  I made sure to add the skills the job description explicitly asked for in the skills section, even if it was just "Working Knowledge".
*   **Action Verbs:** Used strong action verbs like "Developed," "Optimized," "Managed," "Improved," and "Analyzed."
*   **Quantifiable Achievements:** Included numbers and metrics to demonstrate impact (e.g., "5+ web applications," "50% runtime improvement," "90% success rate").
*   **Formatting:**  Uses clear headings, bullet points, and consistent formatting for readability.
*   **Location:** Adjusted the location to Nairobi at the top, since that is where the job is located.
*   **Contact Information:** Added placeholders for LinkedIn and GitHub URLs.  The candidate *must* update these with their actual URLs.
*   **Summary Tailoring:** The summary emphasizes the candidate's suitability for the *specific* role at Kyosk.
*   **"Working Knowledge" Clarification:**  The skills section now explicitly states "Working Knowledge" for Java, SpringBoot, Angular, and Document Databases, as mentioned in the job description. This is important, even if he is not an expert, as it shows he meets the requirement.
*   **Projects Section:** Shortened the Projects section to save space and focus on the most impactful information.

*   **Order of Sections:**  Experience is now listed before projects to emphasize work history.
